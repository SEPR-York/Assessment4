## Where to Find our Code
All of our code for the game to run is located in "core/src/com/mygdx/game". The test files are located in "tests/src/com/mygdx/game"

### Testing
We have used "travis-ci.org" to make sure all the code that is pushed to github compiles and that all of our Unit Tests successed on every push to the development branch so you can quickly identify if something you have pushed has broken the game in some way, our travis is located at https://travis-ci.org/SEPR-York/Assessment4

### Building

#### Running
To run the code run the command "./gradlew run" on Linux and MAC OS and "gradlew run" on Windows

#### Compiling to JAR
To compile to a jar file run the command "./gradlew desktop:dist" on Linux and MAC OS and "gradlew desktop:dist" on Windows. The jar file can then be found in "desktop/build/libs" and it will be called desktop-1.0.jar

#### To Run the Tests
To run the tests run the command "./gradlew check" on Linux and MAC OS and "gradlew check" On Windows. This will run all of the unit tests that have been made and output a to the terminal if any of them fail
